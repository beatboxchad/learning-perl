# Completed on September 16th, 2012

# Write a new program (not the test program!) that prints out any input line
# ending with whitespace (other than just a newline). Put a marker character
# at the end of the output line so as to make the whitespace visible.

	chomp;

		print "\nThe line:\n\n <$_>\n\ncontained whitespace at its end.\n\n";
