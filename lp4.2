# Using the subroutine from the previous problem, make a program to 
# calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1,000.

# This one was a bit easier. I just re-used the subroutine and threw a
# couple lines down at the bottom. 

sub total {
  my $sum = 0;
  foreach $_ (@_) {
    my($number) = ($_);
    $sum += $number;}
  return $sum
}

    
my @pile_o_numbas = (1..1000);
my $pile_o_numbas_total = total(@pile_o_numbas);
print "The total of every number from 1 to 1000 is $pile_o_numbas_total.\n";
