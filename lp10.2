# Modify the program from the previous exercise to print extra debugging in-
# formation as it goes along, such as the secret number it chose. Make your
# change such that you can turn it off, but your program emits no warnings if
# you turn it off.  If you are using Perl 5.10 or later, use the // operator.
# Otherwise, use the conditional operator.
