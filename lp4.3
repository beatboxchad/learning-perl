# Extra credit exercise: write a subroutine, called &above_average, which 
# takes a list of numbers and returns the ones which are above the average 
# (mean). (Hint: make another subroutine that calculates the average by 
# dividing the total by the number of items.) Try your subroutine in this 
# test program.

sub total {
	my $sum = 0;
	foreach $_ (@_) {
		my($number) = ($_);
		$sum += $number;}
	return $sum
}

sub above_average {
	my $sum = &total @_;
	my $number_of_elements =($#_ + 1);
	my $mean = $sum / $number_of_elements;
	my @above_average_numbers
	foreach ($_ (@_)) {
		if ($_ > $mean) {
			push @above_average_numbers, $_;}
}}
	
#The test program:

my @fred = above_average(1..10);
print "\@fred is @fred\n";
print "(Should be 6 7 8 9 10)\n";
my @barney = above_average(100, 1..10);
print "\@barney is @barney\n";
print "(Should be just 100)\n";
