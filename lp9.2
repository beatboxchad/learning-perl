# This is the second exercise from chapter 9 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 21st, 2012

# Write a program that makes a modified copy of a text file. In the copy, every
# string Fred (case-insensitive) should be replaced with Larry. (So, Manfred
# Mann should become ManLarry Mann.) The input file name should be given on the
# command line (donâ€™t ask the user!), and the output filename should be the
# corresponding file name ending with .out.
