# This is the second exercise from chapter 8 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 19th, 2012

# Using the pattern test program, make a pattern that matches if any word
# (in the \w sense of word) ends with the letter a. Does it match wilma but
# not barney?  Does it match Mrs. Wilma Flintstone? What about wilma&fred?
# Try it on the sample text file from the Exercises in Chapter 7 (and add
# these test strings if they werenâ€™t already in there).
