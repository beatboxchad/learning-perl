# This is the fifth exercise from chapter 7 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 16th, 2012


# Make a program that prints each line that has a two of the same
# nonwhitespace characters next to each other. It should match lines that
# contain words such as Mississippi, Bamm-Bamm, or llama.

# This matched a lot of lines containing wiki markup brackets and such, as
# I used source code from the Flintstones Wikipedia page to create this text
# file. Actually, come to think of it, I might just copy/paste the body of
# the finished article into flinstones.txt so it's less funky.  Anyway, the
# code does what the challenge asked, so I'm moving on for now.

my $flinstones = 'flintstones';
open 'flintstones', "<", "flintstones.txt";

while (<$flinstones>) {
	if (/(\P{Space})\1/) {
	print "$_\n\n";
