# This is the first exercise from chapter 5 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 12th, 2012

# Write a program that acts like cat, but referses the order of the output lines.
# (Some systems have a utility like this named tac.) If you run yours as ./tac
# fred barney betty, the output should be all of file betty from last line to
# first, then barney and then fred, also from last line to first. (Be sure to
# use the ./ in your program's invocation if you call it tac so that you don't
# get the system's utility instead!)

## This was stupidly easy. They gave me the answer in an example in the chapter.

print reverse <>;
