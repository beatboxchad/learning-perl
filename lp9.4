# This is the fourth exercise from chapter 9 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 21st, 2012

# Extra credit exercise: write a program to add a copyright line to all of your
# exercise answers so far, by placing a line like: 

## Copyright (C) 20XX by Yours Truly 

# in the file immediately after the “shebang” line. You should edit the files
# “in place,” keeping a backup. Presume that the program will be invoked with
# the filenames to edit already on the command line

  s/#!\/usr\/bin\/perl/#!\/usr\/bin\/perl\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Chad Cassady/i;
  print;
}

# There might be a less error-prone way of doing this, but I don't imagine the
# shebang line appearing more than once in a perl script, so I think we're fine.
