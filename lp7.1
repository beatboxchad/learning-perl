# Make a program that prints each line of its input that mentions fred. (It
# shouldn’t do anything for other lines of input.) Does it match if your
# input string is Fred, frederick, or Alfred? Make a small text file with a
# few lines mentioning “fred flintstone” and his friends, then use that
# file as input to this program and the ones later in this section.

open 'flintstones', "<", "flintstones.txt";

while (<$flinstones>) {
	if (/( fred.?)/) {
	print "$_\n\n";
	}
}
