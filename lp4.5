# This is the fifth exercise from chapter 4 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 11th, 2012

# Modify the previous program to tell each new person the names of all 
# the people it has previously greeted:
#
#  greet( "Fred" );
#  greet( "Barney" );
#  greet( "Wilma: );
#  greet( "Betty" );
#
# This sequence of statements should print:
#
#  Hi Fred! You are the first one here!
#  Hi Barney! I've seen: Fred
#  Hi Wilma! I've seen: Fred Barney
#  Hi Betty! I've seen: Fred Barney Wilma

## This was a very simple change from the previous program. Took me two seconds.

my $name; 
my @here;


sub greet {
  if (@here+0 == 0) {
    push @here, @_;
    print "\n\tHi $name! You are the first one here!\n";
  } else {
    print "\n\tHi $name! I've seen: @here.\n";
    push @here, @_;
  }
}
print "\tHi! I'm the greeter program written in Perl! Who are you?\n\n";

while (chomp($name=<STDIN>)) {

  if ($name ne "") {    #When user just hits enter, exit.
    &greet ("$name");
    print "\n\tGreeter program here. Who are you?\n\n";
  } else {
    print "\n\tNobody there... I've outlived my usefulness. Goodbye, cruel world.\n";
    exit;
  }
}
