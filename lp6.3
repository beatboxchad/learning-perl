# This is the third exercise from chapter 6 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 13th, 2012

# Write a program to list all of the keys and values in %ENV. Print the results
# in two columns in ASCIIbetical order. For extra credit, arrange the output to
# vertically align both columns. The length function can help you figure out how
# wide to make the first column. Once you get the program running, try setting
# some new environment variables and ensuring that they show up in your output.

my @envkeys = (sort keys %ENV);

foreach (@envkeys) {
  printf "\n%-50s %s\n", ($_,$ENV{$_});
}

#I'll mess with printf and get the long ENV values to format properly later.
#Right now, I'm excited to play with regular expressions, which is next.
