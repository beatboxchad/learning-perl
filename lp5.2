# This is the second exercise from chapter 5 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 12th, 2012

# Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of strings on separate
# lines, printing each string in a right-justified, 20-character column. To 
# be certain that the output is in the proper columns, print a "ruler" line
# of digits as well. (This is simply a debugging aid.) Make sure that you're
# not using a 19-character column by mistake! For example, entering hello,
# good-bye should give output something like this:
#
#  123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
#                 hello
#        good-bye
