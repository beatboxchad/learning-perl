# This is the first exercise from chapter 4 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 2nd, 2012

# Write a subroutine, named total, which returns the total of a list 
# of numbers. Hint: the subroutine should not perform any I/O; it should 
# simply process its parameters and return a value to its caller. Try it out 
# in this sample program, which merely exercises the subroutine to see that 
# it works. The first group of numbers should add up to 25.

# First, the subroutine. This took me a bit to figure out, kept having to 
# go back and check  the chapter, and perldoc. I am fighting a bug today.
# FEVERRRR!!!

sub total {
	my $sum = 0;
	foreach $_ (@_) {
		my($number) = ($_);
		$sum += $number;}
	return $sum
}

# Now, the sample program.
		
my @fred = qw{ 1 3 5 7 9 };
my $fred_total = total(@fred);
print "The total of \@fred is $fred_total.\n";
print "Enter some numbers on separate lines: ";
my $user_total = total(<STDIN>);
print "The total of those numbers is $user_total.\n";
