# Modify the program from Exercise 3 in Chapter 6 (the environment lister) to
# print (undefined value) for environment variables without a value. You can
# set the new environment variables in the program. Ensure that your program
# reports the right thing for variables with a false value. If you are using
# Perl 5.10 or later, use the // operator. Otherwise, use the conditional
# operator.
