learning-perl
=============

Exercises from the O'Reilly book Learning Perl, in addition to whatever catches my fancy as I read.

Employers and others looking to see my ability to learn new technologies with a quickness should
look at the code. It's well-documented and commented with the date I wrote it, the text of the 
exercise challenge, and other pertinent information. When I skip ahead or go playing in perldoc
or stackoverflow to implement something I haven't been taught, I'll usually comment how proud
of myself I am, too. Feel free to give me a gold star.

Much more coming soon. I'm tackling Rails within a few weeks here, concurrent to perl, and will 
give that adventure its own repository. Watch also for full-fledged projects. I've become obsessed.


Thank you for your interest.
