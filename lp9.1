# Make a pattern that will match three consecutive copies of whatever is
# currently contained in $what. That is, if $what is fred, your pattern should
# match fred fredfred. If $what is fred|barney, your pattern should match
# fredfredbarney or barneyfredfred or barneybarneybarney or many other
# variations. (Hint: you should set $what at the top of the pattern test
# program with a statement like my $what = 'fred|barney';.)


my $what = 'fred|barney';

while (<>) {
  if (m/($what){3,}/) { #took me 4 tries to get right. Got the right idea on try #2 but had to refine syntax.
    print "Matched $&\n";
  } else {
    print "No match\n"
  }
}
