# Make a program that will repeatedly ask the user to guess a secret number
# from 1 to 100 until the user guesses the secret number. Your program should
# pick the number at random by using the magical formula int(1 + rand 100).§
# When the user guesses wrong, the program should respond, “Too high” or “Too
# low.” If the user enters the word quit or exit, or if the user enters a blank
# line, the program should quit. Of course, if the user guesses correctly, the
# program should quit then as well!

my $secret= int(1 + rand 100);
print "Guess what number I'm thinking of?\n";
#print "For debugging purposes, it's $secret.\n";

while (<STDIN>){
	print "Too high!\n" if ($_ > $secret);
	print "Too low!\n" if ($_ < $secret);
	last if ($_ == $secret);
}

print "That's right!\n";
