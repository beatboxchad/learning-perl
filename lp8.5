# This is the fifth exercise from chapter 8 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 19th, 2012

# Extra credit exercise: modify the program from the previous exercise so
# that immediately following the word ending in a it will also capture
# up-to-five characters (if there are that many characters, of course) in a
# separate capture variable. Update the code to display both capture
# variables. For example, if the input string says I saw Wilma yesterday,
# the up-to-five characters are “yest”. If the input is I, Wilma!, the extra
# capture should have just one character. Does your pattern still match just
# plain wilma?

while (<>) {
    chomp;
    if (/(\b[\w]*a\b)(.{0,5})/) {
  print "Matched: <$1> and then these five-or-fewer characters: <$2>\n";
    } else {
  print "No match.\n";
    }

}
