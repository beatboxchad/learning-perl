# This is the fourth exercise from chapter 9 of O'Reilly's Learning Perl.
# Completed on September 21st, 2012

# Extra extra credit exercise: modify the previous program so that it doesnâ€™t
# edit the files that already contain the copyright line. As a hint on that,
# you might need to know that the name of the file being read by the diamond
# operator is in $ARGV.

# Here's an episode of me having the wrong idea:

open FILE, $ARGV[0];
my $litmus = join '', <FILE>;
if ($litmus =~ /Copyright \(C\) 2012 by Chad Cassady/) {
  die "File already contains copyright line\n";
}
close FILE;


$^I = ".bak";

while (<>){
  s/#!\/usr\/bin\/perl/#!\/usr\/bin\/perl\nCopyright (C) 2012 by Chad Cassady/i;
  print;
}
